*You are in control of your data.*

Blindage is a Python password manager in CLI that stores your passwords encrypted in a SQLite database on your machine.

## Features

- Beautiful CLI interface made with [Typer](https://github.com/fastapi/typer) and [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
- Saves the master password encrypted with the Argon 2 key derivation algorithm with [argon2-cffi](https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi).
- Stores other encrypted credentials based on a key generated from the master password, making it impossible to read the data without the encryption key, i.e., without the master password. This is thanks to the [cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography) lib.
- Password suggestions containing upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters.
- Get OTP codes based on your authentication thanks to [pyotp](https://github.com/pyauth/pyotp).
- Copy single credentials to clipboard with [pyperclip](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip).
